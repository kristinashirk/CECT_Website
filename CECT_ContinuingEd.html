<h3>Continuing Education</h3>
  <p>Continuing Education (CE) students are lifelong learners, whether they be emerging, incumbent, advancing, transitioning in the workforce. CE learners strive for success and personal growth through learning.</p>
  <p>For example, if someone is early in their career, learners often take CE classes or earn particular certificates to augment what they learned in college and as a way to build professional acumen and skills as a way to help them to stand out in the workplace.</p>
  <p>Or, if someone is new to the country and needs a way to quickly build skills and get a job, they might turn to a CE certificate program.</p>
  <p>Many of our programs and certificates are designed to help people with knowledge, skills and abilities in one area transition to another industry or work role.</p>
<h4>Expand your career</h4>
  <p>The new world of work is shifting the way we think about work, jobs and careers.</p>
  <p>Normandale provides adaptive programs and courses designed to support career transition and professional development.</p>
  <p>Many experts agree that we have moved from the age of information to the age of learning. Information is everywhere now and is waning value. Learning is where value is created.</p>
  <p>When people know how to learn, share, create from their learning – real innovation can take place at work.</p>
<h4>Teaching in-demand skills</h4>
  <p>“87% of workers believe it will be essential for them to get training and develop new job skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace.”</p>
  <p>In response to the ever-shifting job market, 50% of Normandale’s Continuing Educaition programs are either new or updated each year. This means that Normandale’s courses and programs adapt to the shifting demands of work, and will prepare you for success in the modern economy.</p>
